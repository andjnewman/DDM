In order to ensure we do not duplicate data we need to know what we already hold and where it is held. We record information about Defra group data on our Metadata  systems - listed here [LIST OF ALL KNOWN METADATA + DGUK].
 
When you create new data you need to record how the data has been created and what inputs you have used; you could use a background intellectual property rights schedule or data flow mapping to do this. You need to understand interdependencies your data may have with other data and processes around the business. You can use data flow mapping to understand this.
 
When you create or acquire new data you will also need to ensure you have an agreed owner within Defra group for the data and record this on the appropriate Metadata inventory. 
 
At the beginning of any project you must ensure that any data outputs can be shared as Open Data, or record clearly in the metadata inventory why they can not be.
 
If you need to develop an information system there are a number of key data  architecture principles you need to consider and comply with.
