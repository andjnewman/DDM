Someone will own the data that you are using you need to ensure you/we have their permission to use it as you wish
 
Internally, you can assume you have the permission to use it for internal business
 
When you are creating data, for example by modelling, you need to understand how permissions for inputs will affect your outputs
 
Data standards help you ensure your data is consistent with other data and can be integrated. You need to know where you should implement data standards in your data.
 
We must be able to state, with evidence, what confidence we have that the data is suitable for a particular use
