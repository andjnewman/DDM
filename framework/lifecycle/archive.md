You must adhere to the data life cycle approach, e.g. decommissioning unused and superseded data.
 
Some data will also be classed as a ‘record’. You should refer to the records management retention schedule for guidance on how long we need to keep these before removing permanently.
 
It is important to know how many people are using your data/ IT/ model / tool and which parts of the organisation they work in before you consider decommissioning. Analysing data flow maps could help you understand this.  
 
It is important to understand whether anyone outside of the Environment Agency is using your data/ IT/ model / tool. Analysing data flow maps could help you understand this.
