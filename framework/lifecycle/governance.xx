Our data is an asset in the same way as our money and our equipment and therefore needs senior people to look after this valuable resource; but it also needs technical people who are close to the data and understand it . 
 
The data we hold will legally have an owner, under intellectual property law, as a result of the creativity and/or investment in collecting and/or creating it. This will either be the Crown or the arms length body.
 
To ensure it is looked after, all our data must have an “owner” who is accountable for the data. The owners accountabilities include the “information asset owner” duties. 
 
Data and information are normally the responsibility of the business area for which they were primarily collected or developed.
 
They have the responsibility and accountability for looking after all data, information and IT systems within their business area throughout the whole life.
 
Data that we use that has come from others should be managed appropriately also, as it is their asset and we have obligations to look after it appropriately.
 
Owner’s duties include making  sure  staff have the right skills, motivation , time and resource to do their job properly
