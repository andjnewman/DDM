When we identify a need for some data we should invest some time in understanding as many of the other potential user needs as possible for the same or similar data across Defra group. This can support our ability to innovate by the use of our data and reduce the costs in collecting, it creating it or procuring it.
 
You need to understand and articulate what the purpose of the data will be to be sure that you can understand what quality of data is needed to be fit for that purpose.
