Defra is an Open Data group of organisations and we need to work with the presumption that we will share all our data, unless we have a very specific reason not to. 
 
Sharing model data (input or output), modelling software / tools, and the knowledge and expertise we have used to develop or review a model does carry some risks and you need to understand the risks when you create or share data, the Open Data Risk Assessment will help you do this.
 
Data should be made available even if it is not perfect. 
 
If you want to share data we have a number of data sharing platforms you can use. 
 
It can take time to publish data so you will need to understand and plan for this.
