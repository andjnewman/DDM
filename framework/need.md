When you identify a need for new data, first you need to check whether it is already available or can be obtained from a third party. This could save you time and money producing or procuring the same/ similar data ourselves. You can do this by checking the National Dataset List or Metadata catalogue.

When we identify a need for new data we must ensure we have an accountable owner, a Custodian, identified and agreed prior to obtaining the data to ensure a direct link is made from our strategic requirements to delivery.

You should also consider as many potential user requirements for your data as possible. Do you know what all potential users may need or want from your data? You should be engaging with customer groups with a broad membership to understand these needs both within and external to the Environment Agency.

When considering what the data will be used for, think about what the customer expects - they need to plan for what quality and process rigor will give you enough confidence to use the data for its purpose(s).

Custodians should have a plan [roadmap] for the whole life of the data, models and IT they obtain, this should include planning for the costs, identifying the end of life and end of contract points for their data, model and IT services. 

DMMI [Evidence] provides a number of corporate, cross cutting data and IT services, business areas must prioritise their investment in maintaining, improving and decommissioning these.

You need to understand and plan the scope, function, schedule and control structure of the required data: what, where, when, who and why.

You should also be planning for controlling data quality - what rules/standards should the data adhere to, as well as documenting the data acquisition/creation process, so it can be repeated. I.e create some documentation on the data now.

Where projects are likely to produce data as an output, you will need to ensure any procurement contracts include the need to share the data produced as Open Data under Open Government Licence (e.g. 3rd party or intellectual property rights shouldn't preclude us from sharing).

When you create new data/information you must consider what information may not be shareable, such as personal data, and consider if you need to make any adjustments to your product specification so that we can share as Open Data.

When you are collecting, obtaining or creating data, you need to identify and record what purpose the data will be used for and what quality the data needs to be to meet this need

You need to identify a satisfactory process and a level of quality which will give you enough confidence to use the data for its purpose(s) and ensure you obtain data that will meet this.

This also applies when you want to use someone elseâ€™s (a 3rd party) dataset you need to check the licence permissions to see if you can use it as you wish, or can share anything created using it as Open Data. If you want to use anything covered by copyright (e.g. images, journals, photos, data) you need to make sure you have the right permissions in place.

Have you prioritised your models and analytical tools against Her Majesty's Treasury guidelines? [not sure I really understand this one]
If you are procuring or creating a system, you will need to ensure this facilitates sharing as Open Data e.g. does the system allow ease of data extraction/ can you automate extraction to facilitate sharing?

You need to ensure the IT infrastructure you use to run your models and tools is supported. You can do this by working with your CIS business partner.  

You need to consider resilience plans for the resources and skills you need for any new models, IT and data you acquire. 

You should think more widely than just this organisation, for example you may need to engage with Defra network re. service funding, monthly publication requirements, alignment of services to meet UnITy & Network GIS Strategy requirements, re-use of new services (e.g. Metadata Catalogue, Real-Time Data Platform, etc).
