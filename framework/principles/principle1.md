Acquiring and maintaining data is a substantial cost to Defra group. It also places a burden on our customers.
 
Using existing data is normally cheaper than acquiring new data. Properly documenting data needs makes it easier to identify if suitable data already exists or if you need to acquire new data.
 
Understanding the business outcome you're trying to achieve; the things you’ll need to know; who’ll use the data; and their requirements will help you to express the data need. 
 
Considering the needs of all potential users of the data within Defra group and within our customer groups maximises its potential value and usability.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- We only acquire new data if there are clearly articulated data needs and existing data doesn’t meet those needs.
- We have a deeper knowledge and understanding of  why we need data and who uses it.
- Data is defined for the widest possible group of users, for the benefit of the whole of Defra group and its customers.



### Technology Implications

- A clear understanding of data needs must be demonstrated before we develop or procure technology solutions.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:
