Building a community around your data will enable you to continuously ensure the data meets the business needs. It will also enable you to continuously test the identified needs are correct and current.
 
Promoting the use of data will reduce data duplication and reduce the costs of data capture and hosting.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- The data owner must be empowered to respond to feedback from the community.
- Resources are made available to continuously improve the data
- Data needs are constantly reviewed.

### Technology Implications

- Technology providers must participate in, and respond to feedback from, the community.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Need]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/need)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
- [Use]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/use)
- [Archive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/archive)
