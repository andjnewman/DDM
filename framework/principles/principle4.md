Data quality issues can have a big impact on the quality of our work and our reputation. Good quality data enables good quality decisions. Getting data right first time helps us to save money and provide better services to customers.
 
Poor quality data can be expensive to fix or clean.
 
The required level of data quality will vary between data, data quality must be considered in the context of the data needs (see principle 1). The quality requirements for the data will be defined in the dataâ€™s standard (see principle 3) and must be measurable.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- Data owners are responsible and accountable for data quality and ensuring data meets the needs of the user community.
- Data specialists help data owners to regularly assess data quality against the relevant standard, and maintain its quality.
- Data quality must be recorded.
- Maintaining data quality has an associated cost that must be considered when budgeting.

### Technology Implications

- Technology solutions must be designed to enable good data quality
- Technology budgets and designs must consider how data assets will be maintained after the solution is retired

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Need]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/need)
- Check({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/check)
- Obtain({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/obtain)
