We want as many people as possible to access and use our data to create a great place for living in.
 
Opening up our data:

- Builds trust in government by allowing others to hold us to account for the decisions we make
- Provides the potential to improve the way we do things
- Enables others to use it to inform and build their businesses
- Helps us to deliver through others by enabling others to use our data to do the things we can’t.
 
We must ensure there are as few barriers to sharing our data, between Defra group bodies and beyond, as possible.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- By default all data must be made open, unless there is good reason not to.
- You must consider the risks associated with making data open and undertake a risk assessment before opening up data.
- Data must be published under an open licence, such as the Open Government Licence (OGL), by default. Where this is not possible the data must be published using the most open licence possible.
- Data sharing agreements and subject consent may be needed to allow sharing between public bodies.

### Technology Implications

- Technology solutions must be designed to enable the open publication of data.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Obtain]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/obtain)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
