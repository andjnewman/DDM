We want as many people as possible to be able to find and use our data to create a great place for living.
 
Being able to easily find:

- Reduces the risk you spend time and money acquiring similar data multiple times and enabling good data management
- Improves the likelihood we use the same source and therefore provide consistent answers to customers from across the Defra group
- Decreases the time spent responding to requests for information


## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- All data must be described using standards compliant metadata.
- Data will be findable in an easy to use discovery tool.

### Technology Implications

- Metadata must be maintained alongside data and made available to a central discovery tool.
- Metadata maintenance must, wherever possible, be automated.
- Metadata is made available to external discovery services such as DATA.GOV.UK.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Obtain]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/obtain)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
- [Use]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/use)
