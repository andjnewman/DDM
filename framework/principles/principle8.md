While we want as many people as possible to be able to access and use our data, we have a duty to ensure that our data is properly protected. This is particularly important where the data contains sensitive information about people, businesses or the environment.
 
Protecting our data will help protect the value of the data and improve data resilience, reducing the likelihood of data being destroyed or damaged.
 
Non-compliance with relevant data policies and legislation could have serious reputational, legal and financial ramifications.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- Data owners must be assured that their data is properly protected and secure.

### Technology Implications

- Data must be stored in-line with Defraâ€™s enterprise architecture security principles and government standards.
- The level of protection applied to data must be proportionate to the content of the data.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Obtain]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/obtain)
- [Store]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/store)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
- [Use]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/use)
- [Archive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/archive)
