The opportunities to use data greatly increase when it is shared in standardised forms. A good data standard helps people understand: what the data is; how it is structured; its quality; its format; how it is collected; and its use.
 
Standardising data offers a wide range of benefits. It:

- Makes it easier for users to access and use our data.
- Increases user confidence in our data.
- Enables better decision making.
- Improves our overall data integrity because inconsistencies and errors are eliminated ensuring our data is fit-for-purpose.
- Makes data linking and sharing easier and cheaper because of improved interoperability.
- Reduces data transfer effort and timeframes.
- Improves technology integration.
 
Some value is unlocked by standardising data within an organisation. However, there is even more value in making data available using widely accepted open standards. A number of open standards have already been adopted by government.
 
Using existing standards will reduce duplication and increase consistency between sets of data of the same type making them easier to use. It will also improve our compliance with mandated standards (e.g. INSPIRE, WFD, FOI).
 
Standards must be designed to address data needs and must be presented in a clear, simple format.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- Before defining a new standard you check to ensure a suitable standard isn't already in use in Defra or doesn't already exist elsewhere.
- You must use widely accepted open standards and government standards where they exist and support the development of new open standards where they don’t.
- There will need to be agreement on a standard if the same type of data exists in many instances  across Defra.
- Where a single standard is not suitable for all instances of a type of data – for example because archived data is held – there will need to be agreement on a translation between the standards in use.
- The Data Owner (see [principle 2](principles/principle2)) is accountable for the data standard.

### Technology Implications

- The data owner must be consulted on any changes to the data technology solutions that are used to manage it.
- The data owner must be kept informed of the initial and ongoing costs of technology solutions.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Need]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/need)
- [Check]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/check)
- [Obtain]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/obtain)
- [Store]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/store)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
- Use
- [Archive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/archive)
