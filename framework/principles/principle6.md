title:  6. Make your data easy to use, linkable and portable
subtitle: |
  Your data must be easy to use, from source, in common formats and if feasible as linked data.  It must be easy to switch technology solutions without affecting the data.

We want our data to be widely used to achieve more for the environment, the economy and society. The more usable and reliable our data is, the more likely we will achieve these aims.
 
Our work to make data available as linked data has shown that further value is unlocked when information is made available in a form that can be linked.
 
Making data portable and ensuring it can be easily separated from technology solutions enables us to change solutions without impacting upon the value or quality of the data. It also enables us to avoid supplier lock-in and drive competition in our supplier marketplace.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- Making data easy to use may lead to additional costs, however these are offset by the benefit of using data others have made open and reusable.
- It is easier and cheaper to move between technology platforms as technology improves.
- The cost of moving data between systems and integrating data from multiple sources is reduced.

### Technology Implications

- Data must be technology agnostic to enable portability.
- Data is managed and accessed from source where possible. When not possible data is mastered but the source and update cycle is clear from the dataâ€™s metadata.
- The use of APIs, registries and web services generates authoritative sources of data that must be used across multiple ICT services.
- The use of linked data methods must be fully considered. For example: the use of unambiguous, persistent identifiers (EG URIs); classifying items and the relationships between them; and linking of items.
- The impact of ICT changes on data must be assessed before the change is made.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Store]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/store)
- [Share]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/share)
- [Use]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/use)
- [Archive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/lifecycle/archive)
