Data is an asset, it has a value to Defra because it enables us to make well informed decisions and provide services to our customers, we must ensure that these assets are adequately protected and properly managed.

Clear data needs (see 1) enable us to identify how data supports our business objectives. It is therefore logical that data is owned by an appropriately senior individual in the most relevant business area.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- Every dataset will have a named data owner, who will also be the ‘Information Asset Owner’.
- The data owner will be responsible for ensuring the value of the data is maintained through good data management practice.
- The data owner will be an appropriately senior manager who:
- Has the authority to make decisions and implement changes.
- Can acquire and approve funding.
- Is engaged in defining the strategy for their business area and hence the data needed.

### Technology Implications

- The data owner must be consulted on any changes to the data technology solutions that are used to manage it.
- The data owner must be kept informed of the initial and ongoing costs of technology solutions.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:
