Acquiring and maintaining data is a substantial cost to Defra group. It also places a burden on our customers.

Using existing data is normally cheaper than acquiring new data. Properly documenting data needs will make it easier to identify if suitable data already exists or if new data needs to be acquired.

It is only possible to express the data need if there is a deep knowledge and understanding of: the business outcome you're trying to achieve, the things you’ll need to know, who’ll use the data and their user needs.

Considering the needs of all potential users of the data within Defra group and within our customer groups will maximise its potential value and usability.


## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- New data must only be acquired if there are clearly articulated data needs and existing data doesn’t meet those needs.
- We have a deeper knowledge and understanding of  why we need data and who uses it.
- Data will be defined for the widest possible group of users, for the benefit of the whole of Defra group and our customers.


### Technology Implications

- A clear understanding of data needs must be demonstrated before technology solutions are procured or developed.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- [Need ✔]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/framework/need)
- Check
- Obtain
- Store
- Share
- Use
- Archive
