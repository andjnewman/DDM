Acquiring and maintaining data is a substantial cost to Defra group, it also places a regulatory burden on our customers.

It is only possible to express the data need if there is a strong understanding of the business outcome you're trying to achieve, the things you’ll need to know, and potential users (our customers and our people) and their specific needs.

Properly documenting needs will make it easier to identify if suitable data already exists.

## Why is this important?

### Organisational implications

- We have a stronger understanding of  why we need data and who uses it.
- To ensure costs are kept to a minimum data must only be acquired if there are clearly articulated data needs.
- Data will be defined for the widest possible group of users, for the benefit of the whole of Defra group.

### Technology Implications

- A clear understanding of data needs must be demonstrated before technology solutions are procured or developed.

## Key data lifecycle stages:

You should consider all principles at each stage of the data lifecycle, but you must consider this principle more closely at the following stages:

- Need ✔
- Check
- Obtain
- Store
- Share
- Use
- Archive
